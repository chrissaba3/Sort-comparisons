Project 1
Coded in IntelliJ by IDEA
Language: Java
JDK 8 or Later required.
***********************************************************************
Instructions to run programs;
MergeSortMain.java
QuickSortMain.java

both programs are runnable, and both problem sets are manually manipulated due 
to array size, that is, according to JVM limits, approximately 1 Billion, so 
keep in mind the limits of the computer.
printout is the time to create array, and time to sort array, no outputs are given 
because they are too large 

TowerOfHanoi.java
Simplified implementation, the only printout is the size of discs and the time to complete

ClassicMatrixMultiplication.java
No manual input necessary, output provides size of array, and time to complete multiplication

StrassenMethodMatrix.java
Code is only provided for n being a power of 2 size matrix, wont work well if any other size
Output is same to Classic program, no output of array given due to immense sizes.

ALL CLASSES USE INSTANT AND DURATION CLASSES, JDK 8 OR LATER IS NECESSARY.

************************************************************************************
Graphs are shown inside of the Excel sheet, you must have excel to view or google sheets may work,
converting to PDF wont work since it cuts off large portions of the data and graphs.
